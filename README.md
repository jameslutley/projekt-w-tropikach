# Projekt W Tropikach

[Staging site](http://projekt-w-tropikach.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com)

My first side project of 2017 is a one-page teaser site I designed and built for my buddy [Stefan’s](https://github.com/stewro) Project In The Tropics (Projekt W Tropikach). He’s putting together a crack team of Polish Java devs, PMs, and QAs to work on some exciting new products whilst travelling around Southeast Asia. They’ll be dropping into amazing digital nomad destinations like Chiang Mai, Bali, and Da Nang in Vietnam.

I had fun with some fairly new (at least for me) front end tech, including ES6 (ES2015), ES6 Modules, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), and [npm scripts](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-i-left-gulp-and-grunt-for-npm-scripts-3d6853dd22b8). I also wrote the CSS with [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/), based on [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss). I enjoyed this experience so much, I’m making the switch from [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) back to good ’ol CSS for all new projects!
